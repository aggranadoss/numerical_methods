# Explanation of the algorithm.

## Angel Granados

Develop, debug, and document a program to determine the roots of a quadratic equation, ax 2 + bx + c, in any language high level, or macros, of your choice. Use a procedure subroutine to calculate the roots (either real or complex). run test runs for cases where a) a = 1, b = 6, c = 2; b) a = 0, b = â€“4, c = 1.6; c) a = 3, b = 2.5, c = 7.

The 6 cases or the $3!$ cases per count have been raised, in the solution of the equation $\displaystyle \frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$. If you use unix-like systems, then because of the complex.h library you must compile it with the following command " $ gcc -o quadratic_equation quadratic_equation.c -lm". The file is in the form cuadratic_equation.c and the executable file is in the form cuadratic_equation. The flowchart is placed:
